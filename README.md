# Loaner Inventory & Management Application
The Loaner Vehicle Request and Inventory Management application is designed to address the current challenges contractors who need loaner vehicles face. The application primarily aims to automate and streamline the vehicle request process, inventory tracking, and approval workflows. Moving away from the manual process, the application seeks to ensure timely vehicle availability, enabling contractors to carry out their day-to-day activities more efficiently.
